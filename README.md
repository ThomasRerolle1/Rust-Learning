# Rust-Learning
*We will explore Rust with the help of the book "Programming Rust" by Jim Blandy and some practical exercises*


##Quick Start##

-First of all we need to install Cargo and Rust: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html and https://www.rust-lang.org/

-after that we are ready to go with our first rust application. For that the only thing we have to do is: ```Cargo new <my_app>```
